Mini E‑Commerce Web Application

This project is a Mini E‑Commerce Web Application developed as part of the CodeAlpha Project Requirement. The application demonstrates the use of Node.js with Express for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. Product and user data are stored locally using JSON files, and browser LocalStorage is used for cart/session handling.
